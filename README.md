## House Price Prediction

### Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices]. 

### Features
- **Data Exploration:** Analyzed and visualized dataset to understand correlations and patterns.
- **Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, normalized numerical features, and encoded categorical variables.
- **Model Selection:** Experimented with different regression algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.

### Files
- `dataset/`: Contains the dataset used for training.
- `House_Price_Predictions.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks documenting data exploration, preprocessing, and model selection.
- `README.md`: Detailed description of the project, setup instructions, and results.

### Results
Achieved a predictive model and demonstrating effective performance in predicting house prices.

### Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional features for better prediction accuracy.
- Implement cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
- Explore advanced techniques like ensemble methods for improved results.

### Usage
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
4. Run `python script_name.py` for training, evaluation, or prediction tasks.
